- Puppeteer
  - Maintained by: Chrome DevTools team + community
  - NodeJS (Javascript/Typescript) only  
  - Limited Cross Browser: Firefox is experimental, Safari may happen in the distant future.
  - Puppeteer is focused on a richer Chromium test experience. 
  - Puppeteer is fast, zero setup and developed alongside chromium, there is tight coupling between the puppeteer version and chrome version, this is a feature not a bug.
  - Uses event drive architecture - which somehow translates to more robust tests and less "sleep(100)" calls

  - Puppeteer generates "trusted" events by default:
    - What does this mean
      - https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#q-whats-the-difference-between-a-trusted-and-untrusted-input-event
    - This could be useful for various things
      - bad stuff, faking a real user more completely
      - Good stuff, better detection of fake trusted events.
  - Bring your own test framework
    - this allows integration into the teams chosen test framework
    - less to learn in addition to the Puppeteer browser control api
    - async operations can be problematic in some test frameworks  
  - Video support may be a problem
    - Uses Chromium and not Chrome so some codecs are missing
    - Can use real chrome to navigate around this
    - Also, it is desktop chrome so no HLS

- Playwright
  - Maintained by: Microsoft + community
  - Language support for: NodeJS (Javascript/Typescript), Python, Java, .Net   
  - Sources:

  - Supported browsers
    - Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
    - Safari is a Webkit browser so is covered 
    - Has mobile emulation modes assisting in mobile testing

  - Autowait
    - https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability
    - Playwright will check for actionability before interacting with an element
    - This reduces the need to wait for elements and makes simpler and more reliable tests
  - Test framework included
    - Playwright includes a test framework. This makes for more consistency between teams using playwright and so more portability in acquired skill set.
    - async is accounted for in the test framework 
    - https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations  
  - Network control and other enhanced capabilities
    - Playwright is able to stub/mock network requests

    - Playwright has access to out of process elements such as 
      - iframes, native input events and "dark mode"
        - this allows testing even more of all the things possibly allowing the ability to test deeper corner cases
